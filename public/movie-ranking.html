<h1>The Best Movies According to Hari</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Transformers</h3>
<p>I simply love the first 3 parts of this franchise. The VFX is simply way ahead of its time and the story buildup, the characters and everything about this franchise is marvelous</p>
<h3>Fast & Furious</h3>
<p>Everyone across the wolrd loves F&F movies. Till F7 the movies were top notch and the storyline is all about cars, drifting, modifying, racing.....so you tell me is there any guy in this world is not a car fanatic. </p>
<h3>S/o Satya Murthy</h3>
<p>This is one my favourites. This is a go to movie for me because I got connected to this movies story and the characters very strongly. Its a beautiful family movies that everyone can enjoy. </p>
